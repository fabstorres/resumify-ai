By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound
by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0
International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License
may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration
of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You
such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

a.  Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that
    is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed
    Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified
    in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held
    by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
    Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material
    is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation
    with an moving image.
b.  Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
    related to copyright, including performance, broadcast, sound recording, and
    Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
    categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in
    Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are Not Copyright and Similar Rights.
c.  Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence
    of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations
    under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on 20 December 1996,
    and/or similar international agreements.
d.  Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
    exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your
    use of the Licensed Material.
e.  Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
    material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
f.  Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
    conditions of this Public License, which are limited by Exceptions and Limitations
    and apply to Copyright and Similar Rights and Sui Generis Database Rights.
g.  Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
    Public License.
h.  NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage
    or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the exchange
    of Licensed Material for other material subject to Copyright and Similar
    Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided
    there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the exchange.
i.  Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
    requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
    display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication,
    or importation, and to make material available to the public including in
    ways that others can access the material at a time and place individually
    chosen by them.
j.  Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from
    Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996
    on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well
    as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
k.  You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this
    Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

a.  License grant.
    1.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
        hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable,
        non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the
        Licensed Material to:
        a.  reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for
            NonCommercial purposes only; and
        b.  produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial
            purposes only.
    2.  Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public
        License does not reduce, limit, or restrict any use of the Licensed
        Material that may lawfully be made without permission under this Public
        License.
    3.  Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
    4.  Media and formats; technical modifications. The Licensor authorizes You
        to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now
        known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary
        to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
        authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to
        exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary
        to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public
        License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4)
        never produces Adapted Material.
    5.  Downstream recipients.
        a.  Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
            Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor
            to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of
            this Public License.
        b.  No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional
            or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective
            Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts
            exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
    6.  No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
        construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your
        use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, sponsored or endorsed
        by, or has the official status of, the Licensor or a designated person
        or entity to be attributed.

b.  Other rights.
    1.  Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
        Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
        personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives
        and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the
        limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights,
        but not otherwise.
    2.  Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
    3.  To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
        from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or
        through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory
        or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
        reserves any right to collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

a.  Attribution.
    1.  If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
        a.  retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the
            Licensed Material:
            i.    identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and
                  any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable
                  manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                  designated);
            ii.   a copyright notice;
            iii.  a notice that refers to this Public License;
            iv.   a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
            v.    a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent
                  reasonably practicable;
        b.  indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication
            of any previous modifications; and
        c.  indicate that the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public
            License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this
            Public License.
    2.  You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
        based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed
        Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions
        by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
        information.
    3.  If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
        required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

b.  NonCommercial.
    You may not exercise the Licensed Rights primarily for commercial advantage
    or monetary compensation.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material:

a.  for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,
    reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of
    the database for NonCommercial purposes only and
b.  if You include all or a substantial portion of the database in a database
    to which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database You create
    (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes
    of Section 3(a). For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and
    does not replace Your obligations under this Public License.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a.  UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY AGREED BY THE PARTIES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
    POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE,
    AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
    LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER, INCLUDING,
    WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
    ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
    SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO
    THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

b.  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO
    YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR
    OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
    PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE
    LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES,
    OR DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
    LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION OR
    LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

a.  This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
    licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then
    Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

b.  Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section
    6(a), it reinstates:
    1.  automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
        cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
    2.  upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right
    the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
    License.

c.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material
    under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material
    at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

    conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

    not stated herein are separate from this Public License.

    interpreted to, reduce, diminish, restrict, or impose conditions on any use
    of the Licensed Material that may lawfully be made without permission under
    this Public License.

b.  To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
    unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
    necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it
    shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability
    of the remainder of the Public License.

c.  No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure
    to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

d.  Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation
    upon any remedies against You for Your failure to comply with this Public
    License.
